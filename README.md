VisualEffectsPlus_1.21.11-fix is an unofficial compatibility patch for Visual Effects+ by dosya.
I am not the original author of the pack; this project only adapts the original 1.21.5-targeted release for Minecraft 1.21.11 + Polytone by fixing migration issues: outdated pack metadata handling (pack shown as outdated / metadata parse errors), broken custom particle sprite binding (waterfall_cascade_emitter), biome-modifier expression crashes on newer parsing (Entity e is null), and legacy lightmap shader incompatibility that caused overly dark visuals and broken block light.
